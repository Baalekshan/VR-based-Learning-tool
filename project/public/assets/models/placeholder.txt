To create realistic 3D models for the VR grocery store products, you need to:

1. Find or create 3D models for:
   - Apple (apple.glb)
   - Banana (banana.glb)
   - Bread (bread.glb)
   - Milk (milk.glb)
   - Eggs (eggs.glb)
   - Chicken (chicken.glb)
   - Pasta (pasta.glb)
   - Sauce (sauce.glb)

2. Place these 3D model files in this directory.

3. Recommended 3D model specifications:
   - Format: GLB (preferred) or GLTF
   - Polygon count: Low-poly for optimal performance (under 10,000 polygons per model)
   - Textures: Embedded in the GLB file
   - Scale: Appropriate for the VR environment (typically around 0.1-0.3 units)

4. For realistic grocery product models, consider:
   - Simple, recognizable shapes
   - Appropriate materials (shiny for fruits, matte for bread, etc.)
   - Proper UV mapping for textures
   - Optimized for mobile VR performance
